 Item Inventory
 A grocery store is keeping track of their produce inventory with two hashes, fruits and veggies. Modify the code in the scaffold to complete the following tasks:

Change the keys in fruits so that they are symbols instead of strings. 

Add an entry peach to fruits for $5. 

Update the price of avocado to $3. 

Remove orange from fruits.

Combine the two hashes and store it in a new variable called inventory. 

Print out all the items in inventory in the format:

Item: banana  Cost: $2
Item: avocado Cost: $3
Item: carrot Cost: $1.75
Item: celery Cost: $2.75
Item: kale Cost: $4

Family of Hashes
In this challenge, you will modify a method defined in the code scaffolding. We haven't talked much about methods yet and we will soon, but you don't have to understand methods to complete this challenge.

Part 0 
Look at the contents of the method (the lines between def and end), and make sure you understand what each line of code is doing.

Part 1
Given a hash of family members, with keys as their title and an array of names as the values, gather only immediate family member’s names into a new array.

family = { 
  aunts: ["Jane", "Jill" , "Beth"], 
  sisters: ["Mary", "Sally", "Susan"], 
  brothers: [ "Steve", "Bob", "Joe"], 
  uncles: ["Frank", "Rob", "David"]
}

After line 12 in the scaffold:

immediate_family = []
Make changes to immediate_family so that it contains the values in family that have the key sisters or the key brothers . The immediate_family array should not contain aunts or uncles .

Expected Output: 

["Mary", "Sally", "Susan", “Steve” , “Bob” , “Joe”]

Part 2
For this part of the challenge, you will update the family hash by making alterations to what is stored after family is initialised on lines 2-7. Determine which array methods will help you to complete the following tasks:

Add "Jacob" to list of uncles in the hash. 

Remove "Jill" from the list of aunts in the hash.
