Demonstrate your algorithmic thinking through completing the following two tasks, in order:
 1. Create a flowchart to outline the steps for listing all prime numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Your flowchart should make use of standard conventions for flowcharts to indicate processes, tasks, actions, or operations
 2. Write pseudocode for the process outlined in your flowchart

 1. Create an array containing all integers between and including 2 and 100. 
 2. print out "Primes in order are: \n"
 3. Create a variable i to store which prime the program is currently up to and give it the value 1.
 4. Repeat steps 5 - 7 while there are elements in the array.
 5. print out the current prime you are up to ('i') and the first element in the array (this is the current prime).
 6. loop through the array and remove all elements that are divisible by the first element in the array.
 7. Increment i by 1.
