CSV: (comma separated values, excel spreadsheet)
https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-3.1.1/libdoc/csv/rdoc/index.html
need to require the csv module for ruby
`require 'csv'`
Now we can use the CSV#methods
data = CSV.read('people.csv')
the data is an "enumerable", which means that it has access to the enumerable methods (like an array)
data.each {|row| }
