Agile Development:
Small, incremental successes over one big development cycle
Including and accepting of changes in product requirements
Smaller development cycles mean more agile responses to what is working and what needs to change

User Stories:
As a [user type], I want to [do something] so that I can [benefit]

Example,
As a new user, I want to sign up so that I can be part of a community

As an admin, I want to be able to delete negative posts so that I can have a friendly environment

As a user, I want to be able to edit my own comments, so that I can fix any mistakes that I've made


Using Trello:
https://trello.com/
Our boards: To Do/Doing/Testing/Done
ACTUALLY USE IT

Lists broken down into a number of cards, these cards are labled, prioritized, broken down into smaller tasks, and assigned to who is working on it (when in a group)

So to be as agile as possible while working on our projects, we should focus on drafting our user stories, putting our tasks into a trello board and working on small incremental successes, then regularly updating what tasks we work on?

Its not really agile if we just ignore our kanban board and do it all after the end of our dev cycle?
