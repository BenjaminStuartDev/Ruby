# Shopping List activity from Coder Academy ED

1. Create a variable (array) called shopping_list 

2. Save 5 items you need to buy into this variable 

3. Assign the value of shopping list to a new variable called updated_shopping_list 

4. Modify updated_shopping_list. Delete a couple of items, and add a few new ones in

5. Print the values of updated_shopping_list to the screen 

6. Then print the values of shopping_list to the screen 

7. So, your changes have altered both variables!! 

8. Using the Ruby docs, see if you can find a method that will allow you to make changes to your updated_shopping_list, without affecting shopping_list

9. Using the Ruby docs, try to find a built-in Ruby method to randomize the order of items in updated_shopping_list

-----------------------------------------------
Is it in the array? Part 1 & 2
Part 1
Write a loop to check whether a particular value is in a given array. If there are multiple occurrences of the value in the array, "Found in array" should only be printed once.

E.g. 

numbers = [4, 5, 3, -7, 20, 0]

value = 5

Output: "Found in array"

E.g. 

numbers = [4, 5, 3, -7, 20, 0]

value = 6

Output: "Not found in array"

E.g. 

numbers = [4, 5, 3, -7, 20, 0, 5]

value = 5

Output: "Found in array"

Part 2
Rewrite your code for Part 1 using a built-in Ruby function instead of a loop. 
------------------------------------------------------
Is it in the array? Part 3
Part 3
Write a method to check whether a particular name is in an array of names (case insensitive). A method is a block of code that groups together certain lines of code (We'll be covering this next week - In the meantime, you can read more about methods here.) 

Our methods must return or give back a value, so instead of using puts to output if the name is in the array we want to return the string "Found in array" or "Not found in array" instead. We can see that the scaffold method has puts before the method is called, so our method is giving back or returning a value which is then being outputted to the screen by the puts

E.g. 

names = ["lin", "nandini", "carl", "zeb", "janel", "varsha", "lavanya"]

is_name_in_array(names, "carl")

Output: "Found in array"

Eg.

names = ["lin", "nandini", "carl", "zeb", "janel", "varsha", "lavanya"]

is_name_in_array(names, "bob")

Output: "Not found in array" 

E.g.

names = ["lin", "nandini", "carl", "zeb", "janel", "varsha", "lavanya"]

is_name_in_array(names, "Lin")

Output: "Found in array"
