# Shopping List activity from Coder Academy ED

1. Create a variable (array) called shopping_list 

2. Save 5 items you need to buy into this variable 

3. Assign the value of shopping list to a new variable called updated_shopping_list 

4. Modify updated_shopping_list. Delete a couple of items, and add a few new ones in

5. Print the values of updated_shopping_list to the screen 

6. Then print the values of shopping_list to the screen 

7. So, your changes have altered both variables!! 

8. Using the Ruby docs, see if you can find a method that will allow you to make changes to your updated_shopping_list, without affecting shopping_list

9. Using the Ruby docs, try to find a built-in Ruby method to randomize the order of items in updated_shopping_list
