Gems:
all available gems found here: https://rubygems.org/
gems need to be required in a file that uses their methods
`require 'rainbow'`
even though a gem is "required" it needs to be installed locally
`gem install rainbow`
always always always read the github repo for each gem you use
commonly used gems for the terminal app - https://ttytoolkit.org/
use bundler for projects
    
Gem Bundler: https://bundler.io/bundle_help.html
Instead of installing gems globally, we should instead use the bundler gem to have a "project relative" list of gems that our project uses
This list travels with our program, and others that clone our repo has access to these gems and can automatically install in one command
Use bundler for your project instead of relying on a user manually installing each and every one of your gems
Install bundler once and only once
steps:
bundle init
bundle add gem-name
as the developer we run `bundle add gemname` then after we push our repo online a user can just run
`bundle install`
and that will automatically install all gems that are in the bundle(gemfile)

to clarify:
as the developer we run `bundle add gemname`
then after we push our repo online a user can just run

`bundle install`

and that will automatically install all gems that are in the bundle(gemfile)
