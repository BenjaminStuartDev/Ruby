File Handling:
Why do we want to use files? Because we can't save all our data in our program, most of the time our data needs to be sourced from an external file and then updated when needed by the program.
Simple run through: https://www.rubyguides.com/2015/05/working-with-files-ruby/
Files need to be "opened" before they can be read/writen
file = File.open('local-file.txt')
p file.read => "blah blah blah"

Methods like File.foreach will automatically open before reading 
File.foreach('shopping_list.txt') do |line|
    puts line.strip
end

File.open has different "options"
"r" => read-only (default behaviour)
"a" => append (add to the end)
"w" => write (overwrites previous contents)
